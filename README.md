# SMC Claude Skills Library

**Star Mountain Capital — Curated AI Skills**

---

## What Is This?

This repository contains **Claude Skills** — pre-built instruction sets that teach Claude how to work specifically for Star Mountain Capital. Instead of explaining your role, the firm's terminology, and what you need every single time you open Claude, a Skill loads all of that context automatically. You just start asking questions.

Think of a Skill like a briefing document that Claude reads before you walk into the room. It knows you're at a PE/credit firm, knows what an LPA is, knows how SMC structures deals, and knows the difference between a platform and an add-on. You don't have to explain any of it.

**Without a Skill:**
> *"I'm an IR professional at a private equity firm. We do lower middle market buyouts. I need to write a quarterly letter to our limited partners about..."*

**With the `lp-memo-writer` Skill loaded:**
> *"Draft a Q2 letter for SMC Credit Fund III. NAV is $387M, net investment income was $12M, and we closed one new deal."*

## What Is GitHub?

GitHub is a website where files are stored, organized, and shared — think of it like Dropbox or SharePoint, but designed for files that need a full version history (every change ever made is tracked and reversible). You don't need to understand how GitHub works to use these Skills. The only thing you need is the link to a specific file. From there, installing a Skill is as simple as copying a URL or pasting text into Claude. This repository lives in the Star Mountain Capital GitHub organization so that the IR, FinOps, and investment teams all share the same up-to-date set of Skills — and when the Skills are improved, everyone gets the update automatically.

## Two Ways to Use Claude at SMC

| Tool | Who Uses It | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **claude.ai** (browser) | All team members | Writing, research, analysis, Q&A, document review |
| **Claude Code** (terminal) | Technical team / FinOps | Automation, scripts, data processing, building tools |

Skills in this library are organized to match:
- `/skills/chat/` — for **claude.ai** users (no coding required)
- `/skills/code/` — for **Claude Code** users (technical / Builders)
- `/skills/shared/` — work in **both** contexts

---

## How to Install a Skill

### Option A: claude.ai Users — Copy & Paste (No Technical Knowledge Needed)

1. **Find the Skill you want** in the table below. Each skill has a file path like `skills/chat/lp-memo-writer.md`.

2. **Open the raw file on GitHub:**
   - Go to [https://github.com/Star-Mountain-Capital/Claude-Skills](https://github.com/Star-Mountain-Capital/Claude-Skills)
   - Navigate to the skill file (e.g., click `skills` → `chat` → `lp-memo-writer.md`)
   - Click the **"Raw"** button in the top-right corner of the file view
   - You'll see plain text. Press `Ctrl+A` (Windows) or `Cmd+A` (Mac) to select all, then `Ctrl+C` / `Cmd+C` to copy it.

3. **Install in claude.ai:**
   - Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and sign in
   - Click your profile icon → **"Profile & Settings"** → **"Skills"**
   - Click **"Add Skill"** or **"Create Skill"**
   - Paste the text you copied into the skill editor
   - Give it a name (use the skill name from the table below) and save

4. **Use it:** Start a new conversation. Skills can be toggled on or off per conversation from the conversation settings panel.

> **Tip:** You only need to install a skill once. After that it's saved to your account and available in every conversation.

---

### Option B: Claude Code Users — Terminal Install

**Install a single skill:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/lp-memo-writer.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Star-Mountain-Capital/Claude-Skills/main/skills/chat/lp-memo-writer.md
```

**Install all SMC skills at once:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Star-Mountain-Capital/Claude-Skills.git ~/smc-claude-skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp ~/smc-claude-skills/skills/chat/*.md ~/.claude/skills/
cp ~/smc-claude-skills/skills/code/*.md ~/.claude/skills/
cp ~/smc-claude-skills/skills/shared/*.md ~/.claude/skills/
echo "All SMC skills installed."
```

**Install for a specific project only:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp ~/smc-claude-skills/skills/code/finops-reconciliation.md .claude/skills/
```

**Keep skills up to date:**
```bash
cd ~/smc-claude-skills && git pull && cp skills/**/*.md ~/.claude/skills/
```

| Skill Name | Audience | What It Does | Install Command |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|

| **Roast** | All teams | Adversarial idea pressure-testing.
